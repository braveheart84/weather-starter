# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `GLOSSARY.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo: keep one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the root.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. If the needed concept isn't there yet, note the gap for domain modeling.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
